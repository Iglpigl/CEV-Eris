changes:
  - balance: Piercing walls now uses armor penetration, inconsistent penetration results
      in loss of momentum
  - balance: Shields have been reworked, becoming a lot more consistent, stronger
      against smaller arms fire, but much less effective against high-end firearms.
  - tweak: Shields now only protect particular bodyparts, depending on how they are
      held
  - tweak: Shield's protective arc was reworked, it now depends on which hand is holding
      it
